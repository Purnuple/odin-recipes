    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced chicken breasts and 
            <br> cook until they are no longer pink and have a golden brown color, about 5-6 minutes per side. 
            <br>Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Allow the cream to reduce slightly, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it is melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet and toss to coat it evenly with 
            <br>the Alfredo sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet and toss everything together until 
            <br>the pasta is well coated in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
