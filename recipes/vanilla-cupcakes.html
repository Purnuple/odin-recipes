    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 
            <br>12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until 
            <br>light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the 
            <br>prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool 
            <br>in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
